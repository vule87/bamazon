# bamazon

Welcome to Bamazon, where we have exactly 10 items to sell with limited quantities. 

In order to be able to purchase the item, you would have to clone the Repo and run `npm install` for all the packages to load.

After that, simply run `node bamazonCustomer.js`, and select the item that would like to purchase as well as the quantity.

If the purchase was a success you will notice messages displayed as the purchase was a success and will tell you the item, price and total amount that you have to pay. If there's not enough quantify, a message will display as insufficient quantity.

Feel free to look around.
